# cs212-Assignment3 
For this assignment, you are asked to design and implement the simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe as illustrated in class.

The following are the requirements:

Define the following classes:

- block.java a block represents a playable cell and maintains a state attribute that is either EMPTY, occupied by X, or occupied by O) . By default it is EMPTY, would require setState, getState, and a toString where EMPTY is just a blank space.

- board.java a board has or contains 9 blocks in a 2D array (3x3) that shapes the game space of tic-tac-toe. It also maintains an internal state which can be one of the following: EMPTY (the initial state of the board), X (X claims a win), Y (Y claims a win), or DRAW (where neither X nor Y can claim a win and no further moves are possible). The board has the key methods makeMove( ) that is called by a player making a move and getState() or updateState() that updates the state of the board after every move. It checks for a win or a draw when they occur. Note that the board instantiates and maintains all the blocks.

- game.java contains a game board and two players, playerX and playerO. It manages the iteration with the players. First by getting the player names, does a coin toss to decide the turn and allows each player to take a turn and make a move. It finally announces the winner/draw when the game ends.

- player.java is an abstract class that maintains a design that every player has a symbol (X or O), a name, and an abstract play(board gameboard) method. It also maintains a reference to the game board for players to examine and make their move.

- HumanPlayer.java extends player, a type of player that requests its input from the user and submit the move (or play) to the gameboard.

- AIPlayer.java extends player, a type of player that implements a simple computer player. The simplest strategy is to play a valid random move. Feel free to design more difficult or "intelligent" game players.

- TicTacToe.java a simple wrapper class for main, here is its contents:

- global.java this is a global interface that is implemented by any class to maintain some shared constants.
